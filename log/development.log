<p><strong>My original note:</strong></p>
<p>Thinking about “white separatism”. What are the ways we separate ourselves physically, economically, and culturally from people of color?</p>
<p><strong>Response 1:</strong></p>
<p><em>Race is a proxy for class. It’s the reason we don’t have universal health-care. If you look at more homogeneous countries, they deal with class issues and not race issues. I think the pursuit of race as an idea of class is the most racist thing to happen since slavery.</em></p>
<p>I think you should be more careful with your words. Saying “race is a proxy for class” is offensive. Race is more than that, and I know you know it. By saying stuff like that you’re excluding from the conversation everyone who has skin in that game. The only people who will engage you on these terms are folks who can be equally dispassionate about these issues. You’re really limiting the breadth of viewpoints you’ll be able to hear.</p>
<p>That said, I agree that conflating class and race is racist. I don’t know about “most racist since slavery”, but it’s racist.</p>
<p><em>There’s no fundamental distinction between rich black people and rich white people. </em></p>
<p>With respect to what? With respect to their ability to buy a Dell online, I think you’re right. With their ability to walk into a store and get service, you’re wrong. With respect to their relationship with the police, you’re wrong.</p>
<p><em>The issue is that black people are disproportionately poor. </em></p>
<p>I don’t think this is the only issue. I don’t think that if you snapped your fingers and removed the money differences between races that all of the sudden all of our schools would be integrated. It’s overly reductive, and, if I may, I think you’re the one conflating race with class here.</p>
<p><em>But because we have created a culture of fear surrounding race, the powers that be are able to continue to ignore the needs of the lower economic classes under the guise of dealing with race – and, of course, at the continuing expense of black people.</em></p>
<p>OK, I agree that the “powers that be” play a role in racism, but my original post asked how do “we” separate ourselves. I think Disney Corp and the US Senate play a role in segregation, but I don’t think you can ignore your own actions.  You’re dodging responsibility.</p>
<p><em>More affirmative action isn’t going to put bread on the table. </em></p>
<p>For who? And who said anything about putting bread on the table? I ask a question about race and I get an essay about poverty. Why?  … especially after you make a (good) point about how racist it is to conflate race and class!</p>
<p><em>It’s only going to further dampen the self-esteem and employment prospects of a group of people whose only crime is being identifiable based on color. </em></p>
<p>What dampens the self esteem of those folks is feeling like they’re being treated unfairly. What makes them feel like they’re being treated unfairly is that we talk about affirmative action like it’s some sort of freebie for underrepresented groups. I don’t see it that way. Racism continues today, baked into our culture in insidious ways that allow it to continue to affect hiring practices, even when racism is not an overt part of the hiring thought process. The system is unfair, not because of slavery, but because of yours and my current racist practices.</p>
<p>And anyway, if peoples’ source of self esteem is an unfair advantage, then maybe that should be dampened.</p>
<p><em>It will however distract from the many, many, readily solvable problems facing the poor.</em></p>
<p>I don’t see how unfair hiring practices are that much less solvable than other problems facing the poor. Why are you trying to put down other peoples’ solutions instead of focusing on championing your own?</p>
<p>And anyway, I don’t think any of this directly addresses the question I posed about race.</p>
<p><strong>Response 2:</strong></p>
<p><em>How can we make ourselves more homogeneous? Who will decide what that looks like? In the absence of strong cultural motivators for this transition towards ideal homogenousness, can we pass laws to accomplish this greater goal for the greater good? Should we?</em></p>
<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>
<p><span style=''''>Is this supposed to be sarcasm?</span></p>
<p><strong>And their response, with my further comments:</strong></p>
<p><span style=''''><em>Erik, the entire point of all those questions was to say, in essence, “This is a complex issue.” We have to pick at the underlying causes of the problems — which are primarily economics and education. </em></span></p>
<p>I don’t think economics and education are the only reasons for segregation.  Look at college campuses, where students have much more uniform amounts of money and education than people on the street.  It’s still segregated.</p>
<p><span style=''''><em>We can’t simply say “Hey people, this is important!” Putting in time to volunteer in at-risk schools, attending community events and forming block clubs (while working with police) are real ways to try and solve the causes of what you’re observing. </em></span></p>
<p>Those are good ideas!  I’m into it!  With the caveat that we have to be careful only to give help where we’ve done our homework, found out what people actually want, and are providing it in good faith.</p>
<p><span style=''''><em>How do you create jobs in neighborhoods that have economic inequity compared to other (more affluent) neighborhoods? I live in East Garfield Park on the west side of Chicago. One of my neighbors got held up at gun point a month ago less than a block from the building. How do you fix that? I helped paint half a school on the south side of Chicago a few months before that because they just don’t have the money — school budgets are based on property taxes. The entire community is poor and mostly black. So how do you fix that?</em></span></p>
<p>I mean, helping paint sounds like a great way to help.</p>
<p><span style=''background-color: #ffffff;''><em>Kind of related; at some point you’ll find that you advocate things that aren’t directly related to race, but effect the race gap. Example – why do local governments still use property taxes as the primary way to fund schools when it so obviously puts rich neighborhoods at an advantage and poor neighborhoods at a disadvantage (which just results in the status quo reinforcing itself)?</em><span/></span></p>
<p>Yea, I don’t know.  I think it relates to the point I made above.  Since people with privilege don’t generally believe that it actually gives them an unfair boost, they develop a sense of entitlement.  They think they’re entitled to spend their tax money on their kids schools, forgetting that it is unfair hiring practices that landed them their job and excluded people with less privilege.</p>
<p>I wonder if greater community awareness that white people, rich people, educated people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc… are all already getting free rides… might help tip the scales towards more support of sharing the wealth</p>
<p>I don’t know, it sounds a little idealistic when I say it out loud tho.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<li><strong>Eat meat and dairy. </strong>Seriously. Now I mean no disrespect against people who can go 100%, cold-turkey, animal product free.  But there are some big risks with that approach:
<ul><em><br/>
Rules and Regulations Burnout</em>, where you get so tired of all the work that you give up and go back to eating whatever the heck you feel like.<br/>
<em><br/>
Becoming an ass</em>, where you start turning your nose up at people for being Less Holy Of Veganosity Than Thou.<br/>
<em><br/>
Becoming a weirdo</em>, where people are completely baffled by your eating habits and sharing food with them–one of the most powerful forms of vegan outreach–becomes impossible.</ul>
<div>
<p>Start with what you can. Vegan-before-dinner. Vegan-at-home. Vegan-on-Sunday. Vegan-except-for-uncle-barry’s-lasagna-oh-my-god-its-delicious.</p></div>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Eat good meat and dairy. </strong><span style=''font-weight: normal;''> If you don’t seek out ethically produced meat and dairy, when you start seriously craving that stuff, you’ll end up eating ice cream made from cows who have their eyes burnt out and live in swimming pools of their own shit. Or whatever it is they’re doing to cows these days.  If you seek out ethically produced stuff, you’ll have a sensible outlet for those cravings, instead of shoveling money at In ‘N Out, because you don’t know where else to go.<br/>
</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid fake stuff.</strong> There are lots of foods that are naturally pretty vegan: spaghetti, veggie chili, fruit, falafel, chana masala, pad thai, peanut butter &amp; jelly, salad, and so-on.  Not only do they tend to be less processed and healthier than that “chik’n” cordon bleu you got at Whole Foods, they are less likely to give you disturbing parallel universe nightmares while eating.</li>
<li><strong>Nutritional Yeast.</strong> Develop a taste for it.  Not only is it one of our only vegan sources of B-12, it will be your strongest ally in the fight against creaminess cravings.</li>
<li><strong>Raw “ice cream”.</strong> 1) Peel some bananas and freeze them.  2) Throw a couple in the blender with a dollop of tahini (or peanut butter if you don’t like the slight bitterness), and add some water and few spoonfuls of cocoa powder (or a splash of vanilla).  Use as little water as possible.  3) Blend.  4) Marvel in the deliciousness and cheapness of your tasty treat.  Ice cream cravings: defeated! (Thx Emily for this life changing recipe)</li>
<li><strong>Earth Balance. </strong>Buy it.  Eat it.  Watch as you forget what butter even tastes like.</li>
<li><strong>Pot lucks. </strong>And general carousing with other vegans.  This is critical.  There are about 500 little tips you need to learn to kick animal products from your diet completely, and the only way to learn them is to cavort with chefs more experienced than you.</li>
<li><strong>Rice ‘n Beans</strong>.  You might as well call them Bread and Butter, because that’s the role they should serve in your diet.  Together they make a complete protein.  They are the cheapest way to provide a good protein/complex carb base for your diet.</li>
<li><strong>Stop cooking.</strong> Stop cutting.  Stop doing anything at all with your food.  See that delicious fresh organic cucumber from the farmer’s market?  Wash it, and take a bite out of it.  Savor the cucumberyness like you’ve never savored cucumberyness before.  When you’re vegan, everything is harder and you need to save cooking time everywhere you can.  So don’t cook.<span style=''background-color: #ffffff;''><strong><br/>

<li><span style=''background-color: #ffffff;''><strong>Don’t beat yourself up</strong>.  At the end of the day, you need to eat, and veganism, while important, is not the only important thing you could be applying your energy to.  If ordering a pizza frees you up to say hello to your neighbors or read a good book, then DO IT!  And feel good about it. </span></li>

Veganism is not about adhering rigorously to some crazy rules. Veganism is about making a small contribution every day to getting all of us off animal products.  And the only way you can contribute daily to anything is if you make damn sure your contribution is of a manageable size.  Do what you can, and no more.  It’s enough.</span></p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>My friend Sumitra today told me her 12-year-old cousin was building a site for her a capella group, <a href=''http://www.myspace.com/redno5''>Red No. 5</a>, and asked what it would take to host it. I thought I would post my response here for everyone:</p>
<p><em>Hi Sumitra!</em></p>
<p>Well there are generally three ways to do it:</p>
<p>1) If you want to have a lot of control, fancy stuff… get a web hosting account. I really like <a href=''http://bluehost.com/''>BlueHost</a>. Downside: it’s $7/month and requires some expertise. Upside: you can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>2) You can use a site that provides a web app that helps you build the site. The basic versions of these sites are free, but it can be another $5-10 if you want to have your own domain name or custom appearance. These sites are much easier, and in some cases cheaper than BlueHost, but you have less flexibility. These are some of my favorites:</p>
<p><a href=''http://www.weebly.com/''>http://www.weebly.com/</a><br/>
<a href=''http://www.yikesite.com/''>http://www.yikesite.com/</a><br/>
<a href=''http://www.yola.com/''>http://www.yola.com/</a></p>
<p>Another benefit of these sites is that anyone can sign in and edit the text and stuff.</p>
<p>3) Get a blog. You can get a <a href=''http://wordpress.com/''>wordpress.com</a> blog with your own domain and totally customized appearance for about $25/year. This is probably a little less flexible even than the sites in option #2, but you can honestly do a lot with a blog. Plus it’s really easy for anyone to update it.</p>
<p><a href=''http://wordpress.com/''>http://wordpress.com/</a><br/>
<a href=''http://www.typepad.com/''>http://www.typepad.com/</a></p>
<p>I suppose the other option, which is totally free and completely customizable is for your little hacker cousin to build the site in <a href=''http://www.sitepoint.com/article/learn-ruby-on-rails/''>Ruby on Rails</a> and deploy it to <a href=''http://heroku.com/''>http://heroku.com</a>. It’d be a good learning experience for her. But it’s a rather advanced approach.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s off the top of my head what I’d say. If you poke around at those options, and you want more details about what you can do with the different ones, let me know.</p>
<p>As for me, I’m doing pretty good. I’m sure I’ll be heading east some time soon. I’ll keep you posted. <img class=''wp-smiley'' src=''http://snowedin.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)''/> </p>

The interviewer at one point casually gendered all Heroku users as “he”. These things stick out to me these days. It makes me think about how it must feel to be a woman and constantly be reminded that few people imagine anyone like you when they think of developers. Which got me thinking a little about gender and race and tech startups.</p>
<p>Now I want to say… I like Heroku. Heroku, The Technology is an amazing piece of architecture. I think it’s a gift to developers, and I think Adam and the other folks who work there are good people. I’m using it for SproutRobot. I know Adam is committed to Free Software, and he was super nice to respond to an email I once sent him about Heroku and F/OSS.</p>
<p>But there’s something that sketches me out a little about <a href=''http://heroku.com/about''>Heroku, The Company</a>, and it’s the same thing that sketches me out about <a href=''http://etherpad.com/ep/about/company''>AppJet, The Company</a>, and most of the tech startups I see.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much all white dudes.</p>
<p>Now, I haven’t seen Heroku do anything as blatantly sexist as making the only woman on your <a href=''http://etherpad.com/ep/about/company''>About page</a> be a sexy mannequin whose lack of development and business skills you mock. But the Heroku founders are all white men, and the only other employee I’ve seen photos of is a white man. It seems uncontroversial for me to say that they’re hiring people for specific attributes that are predominantly found only in white men… if they weren’t, they’d be more diverse*.</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder: what human attributes and skills and ideas are their organization lacking? What kinds of knowledge and experience are they completely blind to because whoever is making the hiring choices thinks that these specific white dude attributes are the Most Important Attributes For Our Organization To Have?</p>
<p>And truthfully, I don’t know the answer. I’m sure their company will succeed. Like I said, the Heroku folks are brilliant, good people, who are doing great work. Lots of companies have made fistfulls of money employing the “let’s look for attributes that predominantly only white dudes have” methodology. But what is lost?</p>
<p>The thing is, it’s hard to know. As white males, we have come to see certain things as “relevant” and “important”, and those values are partly formed by our whiteness and our maleness. Certainly there are values that extend across color and gender lines, but there are plenty of things that women and people of color are more likely to find important than I would.</p>
<p>And this is the hard part. These values that vary across color and gender lines, and I have a hard time seeing and understanding them <em>precisely because they vary across color and gender lines</em>. The things I undervalue because I am white and male are necessarily invisible to me because I undervalue them.</p>
<p>This is why I’m reticent to rely completely on my personal values to do hiring. My values are skewed because of who I am.</p>
<p>So my only choice is to put a premium on diversity. To put trust in people and say “I don’t fully understand all of the value in this person, or everything they can contribute to this organization, but I am going to choose them over someone whose value I can see more clearly <em>because I know there is invisible value in diversity</em>.”</p>
<p>I just have this hunch that what will come out of that will be totally freaking rad. We’ll see, I guess.</p>
<p>______<br/>
<span style=''font-size: 0.8em;''>* I wish this would go without saying, but I know I have to say it or people will get Very Upset: <em>obviously they’re not doing this on purpose</em>. They didn’t sit down and think “what qualities can we look for that only white dudes will have.” They just decided that Ruby prowess, or scaling experience, and the ability to speak in a language they understand… that these are what matters to them. The fact that these are predominantly attributes of white men is a consequence of that decision that I’m sure they didn’t choose deliberately.  In a lot of ways, we’ve moved beyond what I think most people would call “deliberate” racism and sexism (although even the deliberate stuff is still sadly common).  Instead, what most of us are faced with is a more insidious, despite-our-best-intentions kind of racism and sexism.  Whether that kind of stuff is “deliberate”, and whether it’s ethically bankrupt is a very abstract, philosophical question that is, generally speaking, an inappropriate diversion for most discussions about specific race- and gender-related phenomena.  We’re biased.  It hurts people.  Let’s focus on fixing it, not on discussing endlessly whether it makes us bad people.<br/>

<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>Tech is a community where women are marginalized. There can be as few as 1 woman out of 100 at a talk. This means that the audiences are predominantly men, and the women present are, generally speaking, women who have acclimated to men’s bullshit. You simply won’t last in most of these communities unless you have pretty well-honed defense mechanisms for dealing with crap. Generally the only women left in the room are pretty battle-hardened ladies, or they’ve adopted a pretty male gaze, or whatever. They’ve got a way to get by in a harsh environment.</p>
<p>Given that, the fact that most of the men and women at your talk think it is great and not at all offensive doesn’t mean much. It doesn’t mean your talk isn’t extremely alienating to a large portion of the population. It means the women who would be alienated are already alienated from the community. </p>
<p>You’re not pushing them out, you’re just keeping them out.</p>
<p>And that’s where it gets weird. If you want a marginalized group to grow, you have to start listening very carefully to marginal opinions. You can’t sit on your ass, satisfied with your 99% approval rating. You have to lose sleep about the 1%. You have to worry about the one person who had to close their browser when they read about your talk because they got flashbacks. You need to worry about that 1% because in that 1% is where you’ll find the clues to why 49% of the population didn’t come to your talk in the first place.</p>
<p>Or you don’t. But don’t pretend you give a shit about gender issues if you’re going to marginalize those voices.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<h4>Open Source Citizenship</h4>
<p>What are the rights and responsibilities of an <a href=''http://opensourcebridge.org/2009/02/becoming-an-open-source-citizen/'' title=''What is an open source citizen?''>open source citizen</a>? We’re exploring what open source means to us, what it offers, where we struggle, and why we do this day in and day out, even when we’re not paid for it.</p>
<h4>Innovative Track Structure</h4>
<p>Our session tracks are technology agnostic, based around shared community experiences and focus on the similarities between projects, not the differences. <a href=''http://opensourcebridge.org/events/2009/tracks''>View the tracks.</a></p>
<div class=''frontpage_snippet'' id=''lounge_snippet''>
<h4>All-Hours Hacker Lounge</h4>
<p>The geekery doesn’t end when the sessions do. We’re also running a <a href=''http://opensourcebridge.org/2009/03/open-source-conference-prerequisite-1-space-for-hacking/''>24-hour hacker lounge</a> for code sprints, bug bashes, bouncing ideas, starting new projects or just mingling and taking in the vibe.</p></div>
<div class=''frontpage_snippet'' id=''volunteer_snippet''>
<h4>100% Volunteer-Run</h4>
<p>Your software is peer-produced. Why not your conference? Open Source Bridge is pioneered and planned by a team of open source developers and technologists. What’s more, we’re <a href=''http://github.com/igal/openconferenceware''>building an open source application</a> to manage talk proposals.</p></div>

<p>Here’s the letter I just wrote them:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Open Source Bridge,</p>
<p>Let’s see, skills… I have a computer science degree, a masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction Design, and I’ve been doing professional web development part or full time for the last 10 years or so.  I’m very proficient with both PHP and Ruby, (pretty good with Java, C, and C#, and okay with Objective-J and Mac App development) and I’m a fast learner.  I can do graphic design, ui design, software engineering, and coding.</p>
<p>I’m also happy to do whatever… food stuff, greeting, etc, etc.  I’ve volunteered at a couple of conferences… a Boston GNOME Summit a number of years ago, and the SIGCHI Conference in ‘05 or so.</p>
<p>I’m very commited to openness… to Software Freedom as well as challenging power structures.  I am pro-feminist and anti-racist and excited about checking my privilege and doing other things to make computing spaces more open.  I just gave a talk tonight at my local Ruby Users Group (SDRuby) called “Just a Joke? Sexism and the Ruby Community”.</p>
<p>I saw the announcement for this conference a while ago when reading about the whole Matt Aimionetti GoGaRuCo debacle, and forgot about it, and then realized this week while preparing for my talk that I’d really like to be there.  I live in San Diego and don’t have much money, but I figure I’ll find a way up there somehow, if I can get a volunteer position and not have to pay the registration fee.</p>
<p>My timing is flexible… I could come up a couple days before the conference!  Or whatever!  Just say what would be helpful for you!</p>
<p>Love,<br/>
Erik Pukinskis</p></blockquote>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>As I consumed the popular media, I began to think about the more pedestrian views out there. It is important to understand what the everyman thinks, even if one does not agree with him or her (and I certainly <em>do not</em> agree with many of the opinions out there). After all, it is only by understanding others’ points of view that we will ever get ourselves out of these international confrontations. Peace comes when people understand and interact with one another.</p>
<p>A great place to get at peoples’ opinions is the popular new communication tool: <a href=''http://twitter.com/''>Twitter</a>. Twitter allows users to post messages, opinions, and thoughts 140 characters at a time. Each post is a tiny glance at a person’s thought. If you’re not a member yet, you should give Twitter a try. It’s quite fun and addictive.</p>
<p>So, as I set out to glance at what people were saying about the situation in the Middle East via Twitter, I decided to build a tool that would help with this task. And so I did just that, with <a href=''http://twiddleeast.com/''>TwiddleEast</a>.</p>

<p><a href=''http://twiddleeast.com/''>TwiddleEast</a> allows you to quickly glance at what people on Twitter are saying about a few of the Middle Eastern countries in the news today.</p>
<p>Check it out, and I’d love to hear if it is helpful to you. If there is anything I can do to make TwiddleEast better, don’t hesitate to let me know, and while you’re at it: follow <a href=''http://twitter.com/jevnin''>me</a> or <a href=''http://twitter.com/twiddleeast''>TwiddleEast</a> on Twitter.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>This afternoon I was convinced that it was time to get out. Time to persevere (against a zero-degree temperature) and try, at least a little, to get something done. So I packed my side bag and headed out to the gym. That’s when I met my hurdle: digging out the car. </p>
<p>I started the activity the way I normally do: by starting up the engine (because if it’s too cold for that to happen, then there’s no point in the rest) and blasting the defroster. I then brushed and scraped the car, and checked the tires to make sure they were in a good position to free themselves. Everything looked fine, and as I waited for my windshield to fully defrost I thought positively about how I would get out of my spot. I pictured the car rocking gently back and forth and then, almost comically, jumping out of its spot and onto the nice, soft, well-plowed street.</p>
<p>The ease of my vision was not to be in real life. I rocked my car plenty, but managed to get myself stuck and re-stuck three times. Yes, that’s right, I said <strong>three</strong> times. Each time I ran into my apartment building and grabbed the steel-headed shovel, ran back outside and cleared as much ice as I could away from the wheels. And each time I found myself stuck again, only to repeat the whole process. </p>
<p>Finally, in frustration, I decided to give up. This was enough of a workout for the day. Shoveling snow is not as easy as it may sound. You have to realize that that soft snowy powder that you may be picturing eventually turns into big, heavy boulders of ice and hard rocks. (This is why there are many heart attacks during winter…people forget how difficult it is to shovel snow.) As I surveyed where my car lay, I realized I was blocking an alleyway. So not only was I stuck and ready to give up, but I also <em>had</em> to do something to get myself unstuck. </p>
<p>Luckily, a nice man from the next apartment over had seen my struggle and came outside to offer a hand. After a bit of pushing he was unable to free me from the predicament. We talked about strategy for a few minutes, and then another man showed up. <em>“Easy on the gas, <strong>real easy</strong>,”</em> he said. Another couple of heaves and ten seconds later my car was free. </p>
<p>When I returned home a bit later after a drive to cool my insides down I found a nice parking spot that should be a bit easier to get out of. As I approached my apartment I spotted a car with its wheels spinning. With the driver accelerating, I pushed the car out of its spot. A few minutes later when I ran to my car to pick up the forgotten shovel, I spotted the man I had pushed out helping yet another stranger. As I passed he waved and said thanks, and I relayed my story of just an hour earlier. We laughed it off and shared a, “yup, it’s finally really winter again” moment. </p>
<p>This is what it’s like to live in Chicago. It’s a city that’s tough as it is soft. It’s a place where people push past <em>and</em> look out for each other. A place where we don’t interact much in the winter, but when it’s needed, people are glad to lend a hand. </p>
<p>This is where I live and despite the tough parts, I love when the gentle, helpful side of this city emerges. It’s like no other place I’ve lived. </p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>Comics have been a topic of discussion in the Interaction Design Community for a while now. With Scott McCloud providing the art for Google’s message, they really couldn’t go wrong. McCloud has quite literally<a href=''http://www.scottmccloud.com/store/store.html''> written the book(s)</a> on creating effective comics. (Of course, you can create your own design comics too, thanks to projects like Martin Hardee’s <a href=''http://www.designcomics.org/''>Design Comics</a>.)</p>
<p>One thing that I’d like to applaud Google for with this comic is their use of actual Googlers as the narrators of the story. Naming names like this gives credit to the actual thinkers behind the work. All too often in the business world today, we hide individuals behind a big corporate brand. In this example, these Googlers will feel real ownership and responsibility for their product, and they’ll be motivated to continue working on the project even if (and when) they leave Google. Of course, I’d also like to call out the fact that no User Experience team members were named in this document, even in the section titled “Search and the User Experience.” This is strange, and I hope there was a User Experience team dedicated to this project.</p>
<p>And another thing Google did well here was in not trying to over-engineer their explanations of highly technical processes. They simplified their message down to bare essentials, and I felt enlightened after reading this document. Most technical documentation talks down to people, assuming that all the basics are already understood. Google removed some barriers to entry by explaining their new technologies in a way that almost anyone with a little technical know-how can understand. This is something almost every other open source project out there fails at. Technical documentation is far more than simply documentation…it’s an implicit invitation to take part in the experience.</p>
<div class=''wp-caption alignleft'' id=''attachment_624'' style=''width: 510px;''><a href=''http://josh.ev9.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/google-chrome-2.png''><img title=''google-chrome-2'' class=''size-full wp-image-624'' src=''http://josh.ev9.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/google-chrome-2.png'' height=''233'' alt=''Browser Threads Vs.

<p>At the end of the day, I’m really impressed at the quality of this documentation. I actually read the entire thing, which is much more than I can say about the technical documentation for any other software I use. Who knew that I could find the difference between multiple threads and multiple processes interesting?</p>

<p>I hope you noticed that, in fact, we <em>can</em> do all these things today. However, a mere 100 years ago, these questions would have been dismissed as pipe dreams by most people.

<p>This is why I try to take the long view when thinking about design problems. Today’s technology is ephemeral, it will be gone before you know it. But when you find solutions to the big problems, those interactions can last for centuries. So the next time you start a project, instead of asking, “What would the UI look like to solve this problem?” (or even worse, “What will the architecture of the software look like?”) ask “What if we could ________?” And fill in the blank with a really challenging problem.</p>

While I do not agree with him across the board, he does make some interesting points, and helps guide software developers toward the (great user experience) light. I’ll call out a few of his assertions here:</p>
<h4>Software is for humans, not computers</h4>
<p>This is the <em>only</em> absolute truth in the world of technology. Software architectures change, programming languages go through cycles of popularity, and code design patterns will be preferred by some over others. At the end of the day, though, the software we build is <em>always</em> being built to help some human be more productive, happy, or both, even if it literally has no user interface. Before building your next piece of software, I implore you to ask yourself how this software will make the world a better place, as Jono suggests.</p>
<h4>People use computers to connect with other people</h4>
<p>’nuff said. This is the <em>only</em> reason 99% of people use computers at all. (If you’re reading this, you’re probably not part of the 99%. That’s ok though, because <a href=''http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/04/software-design-for-users''>you are not your user</a>.)</p>
<h4>There’s no such thing as free software</h4>
<p>Open Source software is, by and large, really difficult to use. I would <strong>never</strong> leave my mom alone in a room with Linux, it’s just too cruel. Like Jono says, “Linux is only free if the value of my time is zero.”</p>
<h4>The job of the UI Designer is to provide what the users need, not what they say they need</h4>
<p>This paradoxical statement succinctly defines what it is that I do for 40+ hours every week. There are various methods that provide clues as to what users <em>really need</em>, other methods that design for those clues, and still other methods that test whether the users’ needs have been fulfilled. What I do at work all day is carry out those methods.</p>
<h4>User interface design can be approached scientifically. But usually isn’t.</h4>
<p>This is where Jono and I will disagree. He lays out a list of metrics that can bring about statistically significant results when it comes to usability testing software. My clients frequently argue to me that if we drive down the number of clicks in an application it will be easier to use. <strong>I don’t care about click counts.</strong> I’ve seen well liked software with high click counts, and hated software with low click counts. On top of this, while gathering metrics based on click counts, frequency of use, time on task, error rates, and error frequency may get you some information about your software (which is good), these methods <strong>never</strong> tell you how to fix the problems. Real world, in-situ usability testing will tell you these problems, <em>and</em> suggest solutions.</p>
<h4>It is a sin to waste the user’s time, break the user’s train of thought, or lose the user’s work.</h4>
<p>Yup, sin is the right word to use here. Have you sinned lately?</p>
<p>Thanks to Jono for creating this list. Maybe one day I’ll make one of my own. <img class=''wp-smiley'' src=''http://josh.ev9.org/weblog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':-)''/> </p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>There are a few more videos on the way, but those should be good enough to kick off a little commentary.</p>
<p>First off, it should be noted that envisionment videos like these have become an often used tool for Interaction Designers. When you’re intent on creating an experience that does not yet exist out in the world, an envisionment video invites viewers to see how people might be impacted by new technologies, and allows technologists to begin to build the future. Bill Buxton describes Envisionment Videos in his already classic <a href=''http://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371''>Sketching User Experiences</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>As their name suggests, these are clips that are created to communicate some holistic view showing an envisioned system in context. Unlike many of the examples that we have seen, they go beyond just presenting a demo. Rather, they usually are built around a narrative that tries to capture a way of working with technology, as opposed to the design specifics of the device itself…Overall, they are very much part of the story-telling tradition of design.” - <a href=''http://www.billbuxton.com/''>Bill Buxton</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you’d like some more examples of envisionment videos, I recommend checking out the ones Buxton discusses in his book:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=''http://www.lwk.dk/sketch_a_move/sketch_content.html''>Sketch-a-move</a></li>
<li><a href=''http://www.open-video.org/details.php?videoid=8010''>Office of the Professional</a></li>
<li>Apple Computer’s <a href=''http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5144094928842683632''>Knowledge Navigator</a></li>
<li><a href=''http://tangible.media.mit.edu/projects/ClearBoard/''>Clearboard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite envisionment videos is HP’s <a href=''http://www.imeem.com/people/9BTYo4/video/8cxlyLv_/hp_cooltown_movies_video/''>Cooltown</a>, which is extremely polished, but a cool look at the “future” nonetheless. Unfortunately, it seems that the concepts in HP’s video have not come to fruition, at least in a way that impacts HP’s wallet. That’s the way of many of these videos, though. They tend to be so forward looking that one company could not hope to build tools to enable all of the concepts in the sketch, at least in the short term. But, the videos can be used as a guide to the company’s long term future. For example, we’re seeing concepts from Apple’s Knowledge Navigator come to fruition only now, many years after the release of the video.</p>
<p>When it comes to long-term vision, I believe that the “just-in-time” philosophy causes Agile methods to fall apart. See, from the Interaction Design point of view, technological innovation occurs to solve big &amp; ugly human problems. Agile methods encourage developers to build the simplest thing that works in the hope that incrementally (and sometimes iteratively) big &amp; ugly human problems will be solved. But the whole solutions to the big &amp; ugly problems are often not the sum of their parts. More often than not, it takes a long-term strategy to solve these issues.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the Interaction Design and Agile Development points of view are too incongruous to come to terms. Quite the opposite, in fact. Long-term visioning Interaction Designers and just-in-time Agile developers should be able to come together to solve those big &amp; ugly human problems, but must agree that their day-to-day goals are not the same. I’ve seen too many Interaction Designers called in (myself included) to tweak an already developed application’s interface when the entire vision of the product is unclear.</p>
<p>I just returned last night from the <a href=''http://www.agile2008.org/''>Agile 2008</a> conference, and if there’s anything I learned there, it’s that Interaction Design and Agile Development are friends, not foes. However, we need to work together to understand our separate goals and outputs. At the end of the day, both groups need to be successful if we want to build great software.</p>
<p>So Agilists, let’s think about long-term vision a little bit. Let’s create some quick &amp; dirty visions of the future. Then let’s build the heck out of them.</p>
<p>And finally, to return to Aurora, I simply want to say that I am really enjoying the videos. Is this what the future of the web browser will really look like? If the other videos I mentioned are any indication, probably not. Still, there are some fantastic concepts packed into those short videos, and we have a lot to learn from them. I wouldn’t be surprised if many of those concepts <em>do</em> see the light of day, and at the same time I won’t be holding my breath.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>Paul and I have just launched a new blog:<br/>
<a href=''http://visualizingmusic.com/''>http://visualizingmusic.com/</a></p>
<p>from the <a href=''http://visualizingmusic.com/about/''>about</a> page:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the world of online music grows, tools for helping people find new and interesting music in these extremely large collections become increasingly important. In this blog we survey the state-of-the-art in visualization for music discovery in commercial and research systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul and I wanted to create an ongoing, up-to-date resource of all the different instances of musical “discovery” visualizations that we have come across.  We’re defining this as broadly as we can, while avoiding musical <em>signal</em> visualizations, such as all the<a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_visualization''> iTunes/winamp plugins</a>.  Essentially, music discovery visualizations should help you understand relationships <em>between</em> songs, and hopefully help someone identify new and relevant content that they had not heard or considered before.</p>
<p>There is an incredible variety of techniques used to express musical relationships with images, rather than words.  There’s many people who believe the best way to communicate about music is not through words.  As the <a href=''http://www.pacifier.com/~ascott/they/tamildaa.htm''>famous saying</a> goes: <em>“Writing about music is like</em> <em>dancing about architecture”. </em></p>
<p>Be sure to check it out, and if you have any suggestions for new visualizations, or comments in general, don’t hesitate to contact either Paul or myself.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>Researchers in academia and the industry consistently use visualizations to better understand their data.  The standard two dimension scatter-plot is a staple of many exploratory data analyses.  However, there are many cases where two dimensions are not enough. For instance in the plot below, I’ve set up a pairwise plot between three distributions (x, y, and z).  The plots are duplicated on opposite sides of the diagonal (showing x vs. y …or… y vs. x).   I find it extraordinarily difficult to perceive the three dimensional structure of this data solely with the series of two dimensional plots shown here.</p>
<p><a href=''http://www.scwn.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/data-frame.png''><img class=''alignnone size-full wp-image-387'' title=''data-frame'' src=''http://www.scwn.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/data-frame.png'' height=''500'' alt='''' width=''500''/></a></p>
<p>Luckily, R has a package called <a href=''http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/index.html''>rgl</a> that lets me plot in three dimensions using OpenGL.  It even allows for simple interactions with the mouse, like rotation and zooming.</p>
<p><a href=''http://www.scwn.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rgl.png''><img class=''alignnone size-full wp-image-388'' title=''rgl'' src=''http://www.scwn.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rgl.png'' height=''437'' alt='''' width=''500''/></a></p>
<p>This allows for a much better sense of the underlying data… but It’s still a bit limiting.  Many times, there is “interesting structure” in the three dimensional representation that I would like to focus in on, or perhaps there’s just a lot of junk that I want to get rid of.  Many times this structure is not isolated in one or two dimensions, but only becomes apparent through rotating and zooming the three dimensional display.</p>
<p>RGL has a useful method called “select3d” that involves selecting points in the plot, but it’s a bit tricky to use.  Using select3d involves typing into the R console, then clicking and dragging on the plot.  This produces output from the select3d function.  However, the output of the function is… another function!  It is then necessary to apply this produced function on the original data to determine which data points fall inside the selection range…. and then it’s completely up to you what you do at that point… do you filter them out?  Crop them? Color them differently than the others?  It becomes necessary to keep a further supply of methods at hand that can perform these routines on the output of select3d.</p>
<p>This is still all a bit too much to keep in my head for extended periods of time.  It’s also a pain to constantly switch back and forth between the three dimensional plot environment and the console in order to pare down the data.</p>
<p>So, I’ve cooked up a little GUI tool bar that makes selecting, labeling, cropping, and deleting points in the RGL plot much simpler.  It’s called “sculpt3d”, since it’s focused on altering and shaping the underlying data.  In order to launch the toolbar, you first install a small library, and then make a method call:   <em>sculpt3d(x,y,z)</em> where x, y, and z are the three dimensions you are interested in plotting.</p>
<p>I put together a small <a href=''http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZgiQ_Z3KWI''>video</a> that shows me playing around with it:</p>
<p>&lt;object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="350" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"&gt;&lt;param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SZgiQ_Z3KWI"/&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SZgiQ_Z3KWI"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</p>
<p>In the video, you can see how I choose a selection color (a mint green color that I thought would be noticeable against the bright rainbow colored points).  Then I crop the data on this selection.  This is a bit jarring because the crop function automatically zooms in on the selected points, and reverts them back to their original color.  The delete function works in a similar way, and is a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Once I have a smaller collection of datapoints, I might be interesting in labelling them (assuming I passed labels as an argument to sculpt3d).  I can toggle the labels with a click of the “Label” button.</p>
<p>If I’m interested in saving the results of the pruning and cropping, I can access the currently selected points by calling the function <em>sculpt3d.selected()</em>, or the currently visible scene by <em>sculpt3d.current(). </em>This returns the same sort of logic vector that select3d does, so I can now use it to filter my dataset, save it under a new name, and come back to it later on.  Furthermore… since it’s in R, and uses a cross-platform gui (GTK+ via <a href=''http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RGtk2/index.html''>RGtk2</a> and <a href=''http://glade.gnome.org/''>Glade</a>), it’s possible to use this tool and the data on any platform I want to.</p>
<p>Currently, I only have this tool on a local webserver, and it’s still a bit rough.  However, I thought I’d make it available.  To try it out, enter the following in R’s console:</p>
<pre>install.packages(rgl)
install.packages(RGtk2)
rep=''http://ethos.informatics.indiana.edu/~jjdonald/r''
install.packages(''sculpt3d'',repos=rep,type=''source'')</pre>
<p>That last one, you might guess, is the command to download the sculpt3d package. It’s currently source-only, so if you’re on windows, you’ll need to install <a href=''http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/''>RTools</a> in order to compile everything.  You’ll also need the GTK+ framework and Glade (which should get installed automatically with RGtk2).</p>
<p>However, once that is done, you can check the demo out by entering:</p>
<pre>library(sculpt3d)
demo(sculpt3d)</pre>
<p>Thanks to Daniel Adler and Duncan Murdoch for rgl, and Michael Lawrence and Duncan Temple Lang for RGtk2.  Between the four of them, they’ve produced a lot of great stuff for R.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>I recently gave a <a href=''http://ethos.informatics.indiana.edu/~jjdonald/haxe_demo/haXe.pdf''>presentation</a> on haXe at the Strands offices in Corvallis and Seattle.  I think it raised a few eyebrows, but probably ended up raising more questions than it answered.  This was to be expected, as haXe is pretty unique in its ability to target multiple web-related platforms.  The devil is in the details, and so I thought it was best to post everything here on the blog so that interested individuals can go over the specifics in a more involved way.</p>
<p>The demo that I showed was actually two parts: A simple “hello world” trace example, which I compile to  swf, php, and javascript.  Then, a more complex example that compiles some code to each of those targets, and then uses conditional compilation to build a web page that displays output from each target all at once (The PHP target references the javascript source, a javascript method references the swf file).</p>
<p>This, to me, is perhaps the most satisfying aspect of haXe:  The ability to treat each target as a minor variation of an API, rather than as a set of totally unrelated platforms.  Developing, targetting, and displaying results simultaneously is a strange feeling.  All of a sudden, javascript, php, and swf are operating off of the same script, and you are totally in control.</p>
<p>You can download the source as an archive <a href=''http://ethos.informatics.indiana.edu/~jjdonald/haxe_demo.zip''>here</a>, or browse the source <a href=''http://ethos.informatics.indiana.edu/~jjdonald/haxe_demo/''>here</a>.  Once you compile the Demo2 file, you should see something like <a href=''http://ethos.informatics.indiana.edu/~jjdonald/haxe_demo_site/''>this</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a README in the source that’ll explain what’s going on.</p>
<p>If you’re totally new to haXe, you’ll want to download the compiler from the haxe.org <a href=''http://www.haxe.org/download''>download page</a>.  After installing, you can run the build1.hxml – build4.hxml examples by simply typing in:</p>
<pre>haxe build1.hxml</pre>
<p>For each of the build files.  For the build.hxml file (non-numbered), you will need to edit it so that it points and outputs to a working web folder.  If you use TextMate, you can download the <a href=''http://www.haxe.org/com/ide/textmate''>textmate bundle for haXe</a>, and use the editor to browse and build files.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<h2>“using” explained</h2>
<p>The haXe “using” keyword  is essentially behaving like a type of <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin''>mixin</a>, but it’s different than other types of mixins, such as those implemented by <a href=''http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_modules.html''>Ruby</a>.  Explaining things in words is tricky, so here’s some example code.  First, we’ll implement something without “using”:</p>
<pre>// in Demo.hx
class Demo{

    public static function main(): Void
    {
        trace(BarStringClass.addBar(''foo''));
    }

}</pre>
<pre>//in BarStringClass.hx
class BarStringClass{
    public static function addBar(str:String) :String
    {
        return str + '' bar'';
    }
}</pre>
<p>If we compile the code using main() from Demo, we’ll get “foo bar”.  We’re simply using the static class from BarStringClass to process the string and tracing it.  Pretty simple. Now let’s look at what we can do to Demo.hx with “using”:</p>
<pre>//in Demo.hx
using BarStringClass;
class Demo{

    public static function main(): Void
    {
        trace(''foo''.addBar());
    }

}</pre>
<p>haXe now lets us access BarStringClass static functions <em>as if they were functions of the String Class</em>.  In this fashion, the standard base classes can be augmented with additional methods without the need to extend them explicitly.</p>
<p>Notice how in this example it wasn’t even necessary to specify the “str:String” argument required by addBar(). When the haXe compiler injects the methods from BarStringClass, it will automatically fill in the current instance as the first argument… turning <em>BarStringClass.addBar(’foo’)</em> into <em>‘foo’.addBar()</em>.  All of the <em>first argument Types</em> of the “using” classes will be augmented in this way.</p>
<p>So in this case, BarStringClass had one static function (addBar), and the first argument type was String.  Therefore, every String instance now gets the addBar() function.  You could have many different Static functions in a “using” class, and each of the first argument classes will get injected in the same way.</p>
<h2>“using” with types and/or classes</h2>
<p>The other nice thing about this approach is that it works with the more broadly defined <em>Types/typedefs</em>, and not just <em>Classes.</em> So, my IterTools functions that work (mainly) with Iterable Types can be injected with “using”, and then you can do things like:</p>
<pre>for ( i in [1,2,3,4].cycle(5) ){
     trace(i);
}</pre>
<p>…to iterate through the numbers 1 through 4 five times. “cycle()” and the rest of the functions that operate on Iterables would also then work with Lists, FastLists, Hashes, and so forth.  When you add “using IterTools;” at the top of a class file, anything that can iterate can now “cycle()”.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>There are two significant caveats with “using”.  The first is that the injected methods <em>are not available</em> <em>through reflection</em>.  This means they’re not part of the “run-time” class instance.  The second caveat is that it can be very easy to overload several instances of a single method name (from multiple “using” classes).  Currently, haXe’s behavior is to only use the first matching static method from a “using” Class.</p>
<h2>“using” can be habit forming</h2>
<p>Some of the positives to the “using” keyword approach are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can manage classes externally from code that defines them, seamlessly adding in functionality by augmenting classes and typedefs.</li>
<li>Anything you can do through the “using” keyword can be done by using Static Classes, so there is very little ‘magic’ going on… just some clever reformatting of function calls.</li>
<li>There’s a ton of Static classes out there (in addition to <a href=''http://www.scwn.net/haxe/''>my own</a>) that already contain a lot of good practical functionality.  You can easily reuse these classes as “using” classes, or write your own that handle specific needs.</li>
<li>Method completion works with –display.  So once you include the “using” keyword with an appropriate class, you can instantly see the extra available methods by triggering a code-completion request inside your editor (assuming the editor does –display code completion).</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m assuming “using” will be added in the next version of haXe (2.04).  Till then, you can play around with it by <a href=''http://haxe.org/doc/advanced/compiler_guide''>downloading and building from the CVS sources</a>.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>In the interest of self disclosure, I didn’t read the book, because I tend to be more interested in what people do than what they say to do. The cliff notes versions I’ve seen on line seem to imply that he has rediscovered the Pareto Principle, or the incredibly well worn 80/20 rule, along with a host of other efficiency principles that seem incredibly hackneyed.  I’m not sure what his unique twist is, maybe he’s good at telling stories.</p>
<p>It turns out Tim’s claim to fame is that he’s gotten very good at finding success in niche activities on technicalities, and then marketing the hell out of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>He’s a Chinese Kickboxing champion, which he achieved by shoving the smaller opponents out of the ring, and winning through their disqualification.</li>
<li>He’s an expert at Argentine tango, where he has set a record for spinning.  This isn’t really a technical feat, it was more of a <a href=''http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9pWKB2D23k&eurl=http%3A//tangocherie.blogspot.com/2007/06/most-tango-spins-in-one-minute-tim.html&feature=player_embedded''>novelty act for the Kelly Ripa show</a>.</li>
<li>He lectures at Princeton’s electrical engineering group (on entrepreneurship).</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that very few people can actually benefit from what he talks about, mainly because he proposes “outsourcing” minute details of daily planning (to personal assistants in India… seriously!).  I don’t know if he’s thought about marketing his book in India (<a href=''http://www.theonion.com/content/video/more_american_workers_outsourcing?utm_source=videoembed''>who would <em>they</em> outsource to?</a>).  He also is against liberal use of cell phones and e-mail.</p>

<p>Another blogger by the name of Sam Crawley gives an overview of the way that roles provide more flexibility in a <a href=''http://samcrawley.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/roles-and-duck-typing-apples-and-oranges/''>recent post</a>, however there is still a significant difference in approaches.</p>
<h2>Duck Typing and Reflection</h2>
<p>In both the original post on duck types and Perl Roles, as well as Sam’s rebuttal of my previous article, there is mention of the “can” method.  This method is used like:</p>
<pre><code>$dog_or_tree-&gt;can( ''bark'' ); </code></pre>
<p>This method tests to see if an object has the requisite field (presumably so that you can call a corresponding method, or access a property), and is very similar to the intent of duck typing.  However, it’s important to note that using this “can” method is <em>not</em> the same as duck typing.  The method is actually what’s known as a <em>runtime</em> <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29''>class reflection</a>, and not a <em>compile-time</em> type check.  This is an important distinction, because  true duck-typing will make the compiler check the types <em>once</em> before compilation, while reflection requires that the types be checked <em>every time the code is run</em>.  On many platforms (VM’s such as Adobe’s AVM2) reflection calls are quite slow, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>It seems that both authors are conflating these approaches, and unfairly criticizing duck typing for the inefficiencies of managing types through reflection:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to get stricter, and if your language supports this, you can even check the arity or types of the allowed signatures of the method — but look at all of the boilerplate code you have to write to make this work. That’s also code to check only a <em>single</em> method.</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t need to insert “boilerplate code” in your classes for conventional duck typing approaches.  You write one “typedef” of required methods, as in a haXe example:</p>
<pre>typedef Duck ={
 function walks(location:Position, direction:Vector&lt;Float&gt;):Waddle&lt;Step&gt;;
 function talks(say:String):Quack&lt;Sound&gt;;
}</pre>
<p>And typically put it somewhere in your compiler class path.  Now you can accept “Ducks” as arguments anywhere, and they can be checked by the compiler.  From a typedef, we can assert that the Duck walks and talks appropriately (producing “Waddle” and “Quack” collections of “Steps” and “Sounds”).  The <em>arity</em>, return, and argument types let us describe the behavior in great detail.  The level of discrimination that is available only depends on the specificity of the classes, and any duck type assertions occur externally to class specific code.  After we write our Main classes, and create the Duck typedef, we could perhaps differentiate between different ducks, such as those that “molt() : Void”, and we wouldn’t need to update any existing class code outside of creating a new typedef:</p>
<pre>typedef MoltingDuck = {
     &gt; Duck,
     function molt():Void
}</pre>
<p>Now we can make sure we’re dealing with molting ducks, that behave exactly like ducks in every other way.</p>
<h2>Roles vs. Duck Typing, revisited</h2>
<p>However, for a final comparison of Roles and Duck Typing, it is perhaps fair to say that Roles are more powerful in a sense.  Roles actually cover a lot of ground, it’s just different ground than what Duck Typing covers.  Roles encompass <em>two</em> major forms of class specification:  <em><a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28computer_science%29''>interfaces</a> </em>and<em> <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin''>mixins</a>. </em> The former lets you define methods and properties that <em>must be</em> implemented by the host class, while the latter define methods and properties that <em>are implemented by the Role itself </em>(the methods are specified in the Role description)  In this way, you can even use Roles as building blocks for class functionality in lieu of inheritance.  It seems that this is a pretty revolutionary way to approach OOP, so more power to them.</p>
<p>However, the  type checking performed by Roles <em>is</em> more rigid and structured than duck typing, at least in terms of what happens at the compiler level. You still must declare a Role <em>inside</em> of a class description (a la interfaces) for compile time checking.  For interpreted languages, it may not be that important to distinguish between type checking that occurs at the compiler vs. the checks that occur at run-time.  However, this distinction can be very important for other languages.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the need for articles to promote the idea of Roles within and without the Perl community, but I think it can also be done without unfairly criticising other approaches.  Despite the inaccuracies, the discussion of Roles has gotten me interested in Perl again, and nothing else has done that in years.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>I recently read an article talking about the <a href=''http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/05/perl-roles-versus-duck-typing.html''>new “roles” system in Perl</a>. Roles are classes of objects that perform the same set of functions.  So, if you had an “Eagle” object, or a “Sparrow” object, perhaps both would have the field “feathers”, and the function “fly”.   Each object might then differ in the size of the beak, or maybe only the Eagle has the method “swoop”.  Perl roles would let you tag a collection of methods (in this case, “feathers” and “fly”) as performing a certain role (in this case, probably “flying_bird”).  This is pretty useful, because if you wanted to write a (simple) bird watching simulator, you could handle any type of bird object as long as it handled that method and that property.  If the method names are slightly different (for instance, perhaps the “Condor” object  has the method “soar” instead of “fly”), but behave the same, Roles can resolve this.</p>
<h2>Know Your Role</h2>
<p>Perl’s role system is in contrast to <a href=''http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuckTyping''><em>duck</em> typing</a> that I use a lot in <a href=''http://haxe.org/doc/features''>haXe</a>.  Duck typing skips the process of setting up explicit roles, and just tries to match the field/method names explicitly.  So, any object that can “fly” and has “feathers” can be considered as a “flying bird” without the need of declaring roles in each object.  The matching parameters for a duck type are typically given in a <em>typedef, </em>which is just a list of field names and types.</p>
<p>The article states that roles have the following advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roles are explicitly given for classes… in their case they use the example of a field “bark”, which might belong to a “tree” or a “dog” object… duck typing perhaps could confuse them.  Roles would not.</li>
<li>Roles are more flexible… you have more fine grained control over what constitutes or is compatible with a role.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Better Examples</h2>
<p>However, I’m not sold. The example they give (”bark” belonging to both “trees” and “dogs”) is not a good one.  “Tree bark” seems like it would be a property, while “Dog bark” seems like it would be a method/action.  This could easily be detected by most duck type checking languages, and would clear up a great deal of field naming confusion right away.</p>
<p>The “old cliché” that they reference (if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck, then it is a duck) actually gives a better example.  In this case, duck typing is occurring on <em>two </em>fields, rather than one.  The chances that classes have two fields that are identically named, yet pertain to unrelated objects is much lower.  In the article they say that  <em>“roles add context back”, </em>but I would argue that context can get added back by being more specific with typedefs.</p>
<h2>Using Natural Language Instincts</h2>
<p>This ability to manage specificity through the selection and addition of representative symbols is an integral part of our natural language abilities.  We use it every time we need to search the web (If I wanted to specify that I’m looking for dog-like bark things, I might query “bark woof”, rather than just “bark”.  The specification is only as complex as it needs to be, and it relies on human knowledge to decide which terms best describe/discriminate the necessary object properties.  It also doesn’t rely on specifically describing the roles beforehand, or explicitly indicate which objects perform which role.  Duck typing <em>does</em> rely on programmers to differentiate their classes semantically through field names, which I consider good coding practice (i.e. don’t have two fundamentally different classes that have the same field names, and don’t have similar classes with completely different field names).</p>
<p>In the end, it boils down to managing complexity.  Perl roles will force you to specify all of your roles explicitly, and require that appropriate object class code indicate a role behavior where necessary.  This is “bad” complexity imho, since it involves a lot of boilerplate and class code markup.  On the other hand, duck typing will force you to be very careful and specific with how you define a typedef, and occasionally force you to change how fields are named.  In certain cases, it might keep you from treating certain classes as related when necessary, or it might confuse two unrelated classes… all on the basis of whether fields match or not.</p>
<h2>Managing Type Context with Duck Typing</h2>
<p>Certain duck type situations can cause false-negative or false-positive  typing conflicts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Classes should have the same basic typedef, but have mismatched field names (false-negative typing):  This is usually the result of bad coding style for the classes.  Use this as an opportunity to rename the mismatched field names to something more consistent.  Sometimes getter/setter mechanisms interfere with a field match.  If one class uses a getter/setter for a property field, consider adopting the same behavior on the other class.</li>
<li>Classes are not related, but the typedef selects both of them (false positive typing):  See if there’s another field that can be added to the duck type check.  Usually this will let you discriminate between the two classes.</li>
</ol>
<p>There still could be certain situations where duck typing fails, and in these cases, I typically fall back on class <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_science%29''>reflection</a> and other methods to get things working.  However, these cases are very rare for me.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both approaches have drawbacks, but I find that duck typing allows me to handle complexity in more familiar natural language terms, while roles are more rigid and top-down.  The former is better if I’m working on my own projects, but perhaps roles really shine when you have to work with larger classes that you don’t have control over or want to modify extensively.</p>
<p>I’m surprised that Perl went with such a strong top-down approach for determining object class types.  It really seems to go against its loosely-styled ad-hoc nature.  Perl has become somewhat stagnant in recent years, so perhaps this is an attempt to shake things up a bit.  If so, I have doubts whether it’s a step in the right direction.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>In addition to assuming that social networks can be applied to nearly any business endeavor, there was also the sense that a greater utilization of these networks would somehow improve some sort of social awareness, and by corollary, provide the participating users with greater ‘access’ to individuals in otherwise inaccessible or distant locations.</p>
<p>To a certain degree, this is true.  People can keep tabs on distant friends, families, and colleagues in very informal fashion using facebook and twitter, but there <em>has</em> to be limits to <em>how many</em> meaningful social connections an individual can maintain, at a minimum level of awareness…</p>
<p>The general sense seems to be that “more friends=better”, and entire careers seem to have been built on <a href=''http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1570728%2C00.html''>exploiting social networks for self promotion</a>.  However, turning your personal social network into a competitive  ‘numbers game’ seems… well… wrong.  It turns out there are <a href=''http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/2006/12/logn_0093_3389_logcr_1_r20764.php''>pretty well defined ‘averages’</a> for how many <em>meaningful</em> relationships an individual can maintain.  Basically, there are three thresholds for social connections.</p>
<ol>
<li>5 individuals = A number influenced by our working short term memory.  This seems to be the maximum level of individuals that you can become ‘intimately familiar’ with.  You might be able to predict how this individual would respond to given situations, or finish their sentences for them.</li>
<li>15 individuals = The maximum number of individuals you can form a “deep trust” with.  These are individuals that you feel completely relaxed and unguarded around.</li>
<li>150 individuals = The maximum number of individuals you can “enumerate” and identify with in a meaningful fashion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 150 number is a far cry from the thousands of friends on facebook/myspace that many people seem driven to acquire.  In fact, the very act of ‘friending’ someone on facebook <a href=''http://vator.tv/news/show/2009-01-21-nytimes-cautions-against-twitter-and-facebook''>may have undermined the  meaning of the word ‘friend’</a>.  Perhaps all that facebook/myspace needs is clearer semantics behind the connections its users form, but it does feel to me at times that the notion of and online ‘friend’ has become garbled… and it seems that <em>limiting</em> the amount of connections you can make might be a start towards making them more useful.</p>
<p>Designing for social networks using these real-world social/cognitive limits might lead to some different interaction arrangements.  I had thought of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For my “select 5″, I would give them the opportunity to directly connect/interrupt me at almost any time.  Richer communication channels (video/voice) would be enabled by default.</li>
<li>For my “trusted 15″, I would grant the opportunity to directly respond on any blog postings/etc without explicit editorial permission.  I would publish personal status messages and inside jokes through a limited public interface.</li>
<li>For my “group of 150″, I would grant permission to see pictures of me and my other friends (I think face recognition technolgy would be great to automatically tag and filter photos so that I wouldn’t have to).  I would publish less personal/professional messages that they would be able to see.</li>
<li>For any individuals above that number, they would be able to see non-personally-identifiable pictures, blog posts, and professional messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I think as social networks mature…’less’ will be/mean more.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>Anyways, I’ve started doing some things that I think help greatly, and since many of my friends/colleagues are also going through this same process, and mentioned the same problems, I thought I could share some of what I’ve started doing that seems to help.  I’ll give them here in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mood:  It’s really easy to get into weird mood swings, particularly if you’re like me, and are no longer on campus, and don’t have a bunch of others around to keep you in check.  If you have serious emotional problems, then this advice is not for you.  However, I think most people will go through some sort of strange mood while writing, it’s just part of the process.  What has helped me a lot in this area has been a simple amino acid called <a href=''http://www.amazon.com/L-Methionine-NOW-Foods-Fitness-Capsules/dp/B000JCN6YG/ref%3Dpd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=sporting-goods&qid=1239030402&sr=8-1''>L-Methionine</a>.  This is a biochemical precursor to Sam-e, a more expensive natural hormone related to joint strength and mood control.  I take L-Methionine, and have noticed a marked improvement in mood with no adverse side effects.  I realize of course that all of this is unproven according to the FDA, and some people consider it useless.  However, it is perfectly safe.  YMMV.</li>
<li>Sleep: I’ve always had problems sleeping, and it gets worse when I travel.  Some of my collegaues suggested <a href=''http://www.amazon.com/Schiff-Melatonin-Plus-25-Theanine/dp/B000FCEB2G/ref%3Dpd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1239030897&sr=8-1''>Melatonin</a>, which they use to get over jet lag.  I have to give it my endorsement as well.  I’ve tried prescription strength sleep aids, but this is far better.  No side-effects, non-habit forming, and it doesn’t even make me dangerously drowsy.  I just feel ready to go to sleep, and sleep better than I do without it.</li>
<li>Exercise:  It’s remarkable to me how exercise can change my mental state.  It only takes about 30 min. of jogging, etc. before I have a new perspective on things.  It’s also my “<a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sentinels#Canaries_in_coal_mines''>canary in the coal mine</a>” for my weekly routine.  If I’m not having a good workout, it usually means I’m not getting enough sleep, or not eating right, etc.  Then it’s time for a change.</li>
<li>Diet:  Some people are able to control all of these factors with diet and exercise.  More power to them.  I like more of  a variety, so I tend to eat whatever I want (within reason).  I’ve got nothing really profound here:  the wrong kinds of food can throw everything off kilter, so it’s good to be aware of how they affect you.  Generally, I eat first, and ask questions later.  It doesn’t get me into too much trouble.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, these are just tips that seem to work for me, and aren’t supposed to be a guideline.  I also don’t consider myself one of the “all-natural” crowd, nor do I endorse any sort of chemical stimulant/barbituate (everything I’ve referenced here has weaker side effects than caffeine/tylenol pm).  Writing the dissertation is shaping up to be a long, drawn out affair, and I’m very aware of the percentage of people who end up being <a href=''http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_But_Dissertation''>A.B.D</a>, which may be as high as 50% in some areas.  I just am going to use every tool I have available, and wanted to share them as well.</p>', NULL, NULL)[0m

<p>At first glance, this perhaps appears to be a bit of a ‘fringe’ topic.  Visualizations are often seen as more of an art form than a straightforward research tool.  However, I believe that music is a special form of information.  On one hand it behaves according to a set of physical rules, following certain spectral behaviors as an acoustic signal.  On the other hand, it behaves as a cultural icon, following another set of rules in a network of contextual associations and systems of meaning.  On yet another hand, it is understood in a musicological system of compositional symbols and structures.  To study and understand only one aspect of music is to have an incomplete grasp of the role it plays in the other systems.  You could spend an incredible amount of time understanding how musical information is related in each context.  Perhaps this is why music information retrieval projects spanning different music metadata types are somewhat rare.</p>
<p>Paul and I are believers that visualizations can be effective “big picture” overviews of music corpus information in many different contexts, and can be a great first step towards understanding how each form of music metadata reflects an important way of understanding music.  We hope to use our combined expertise to produce a useful overview of the current state of the art in music corpus visualization, as well as provide some useful open source tools for researchers to investigate their own musical information visually.</p>
<p>We’ve been gathering a lot of existing relevant projects already, and have tagged them all on <a href=''http://delicious.com/tag/MusicVizismir2009''>del.icio.us</a>.  There’s a lot of great projects on there, and it’s worth a look.  If you think we’ve missed something, tag the respective website with “MusicVizIsmir2009″ and we’ll check it out and add it to our collection.</p>
